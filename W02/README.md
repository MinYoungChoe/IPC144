# Workshop #2: Computations: Types, A Simple Calculation, Expressions

This is second work that I have done using C language in First semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I wrote code and executed a C language program that accepts numerical values from the user, stores the values in variables of the appropriate data type, performs calculations on the stored variables (including the modulus operator) and casts from one data type to another.
