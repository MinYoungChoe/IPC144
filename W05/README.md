# Workshop #5: Computations: Modularity: Structures

This is fifth work that I have done using C language in First semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I wrote and executed a C language program applying user-defined data types (structures). 
The game requires the player to enter move location commands to reveal what is hidden at a given position along the path. 
The object of the game is for the player to find as many treasures as possible before running out of moves or lives. 
Discovering a bomb will reduce the player’s life count. 
Discovering a treasure will earn the player treasure points. 
Discovering both, a treasure with a bomb in the same location will reduce the player’s life count and earn the player treasure points (consider it a life insurance payout). 
Prior to playing the game, the program will prompt the user to perform some upfront configurations
