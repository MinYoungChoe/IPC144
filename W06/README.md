# Workshop #6: Computations: Modularity: Functions and Pointers

This is sixth work that I have done using C language in First semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I worte and executed a C language program that evaluates the cheapest cat food product based on a simple analysis.
Data will be entered for three similar products and then displayed back to the user in a tabular table format.
The data will be analyzed and displayed with additional calculated information in the form of a formatted table revealing the analysis.
The program concludes with the suggested cheapest product.
