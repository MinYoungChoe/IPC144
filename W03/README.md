# Workshop #3:Computations: Logic (sequence, selection, iteration, flags, nesting)

This is third work that I have done using C language in First semester at Seneca college.

In this workshop, I wrote code and executed a C language program that implements simple validation on a series of user input values,
and then analyzes the data to provide a statistical summary.
